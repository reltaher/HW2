# Structure of Implementation/Decision Designs

The algorithm was implemented using the OBST pseudo-code provided by this class/the book for this class. Within the class, I also added a feature to store the tables e, w, and root to a file. The algorithm is being executed while the table is being stored to the file, and this is where I time the performance of the algorithm. Once file storage is finished, the program outputs the time it took to execute the algorithm and to store the keys into the file. The user can choose how many keys he or she may store between 10, 100, 1000, 10000, or 100000 keys. The program will provide the user an option to choose one of these keys amount, and this will be the amount of keys that are randomly generated, stored to the table, and then stored to the file.

# How to Execute This Program

1) Clone this repository. A guide on cloning repositories can be found [here.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2) Open the repository on an IDE that runs Java programs, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ.
3) Configure the IDE so that it has the appropriate main class, and the program should run.
